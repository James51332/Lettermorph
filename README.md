# Lettermorph

This is a word-themed game in which the player attempts to connect one word to another by changing only one letter at a time, with each change resulting in a valid English word.

### Installation

The game can be downloaded in one of prepackaged releases, or alternatively built from source. Note that the packaged builds are only available for macOS. The build-system generator used is [premake5](https://github.com/premake/premake-core), which can be installed using a package manager such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh) or directly from the premake website for other platforms. This would enable the game to be built for Windows, Linux, or nearly any other platform supported by SDL. on macOS, or by downloading prebuilt binaries on other platforms. On macOS, static binaries for each of are dependencies are included in the repo. 

### Licensing
